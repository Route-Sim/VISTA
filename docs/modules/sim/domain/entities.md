# SIM Domain Entities

> Purpose: Define the immutable shapes of the simulation world. All relations are expressed with branded IDs to keep the domain serializable and portable. No methods; mutation occurs through reducers operating on snapshots.

## Responsibilities & Boundaries

- In-scope: type definitions for `Node`, `Edge`, `Road`, `Building` hierarchy (`Building`, `Depot`, `GasStation`, `Site`), `Truck`, `Package`, `Agent`.
- Out-of-scope: network payloads, three.js objects, rendering.

## Highlights

- Site is modeled as a subtype of Building; `SiteId` is an alias of `BuildingId`.
- `Road` extends `Edge` functionally; we alias `RoadId = EdgeId` so the same identity can be used in both maps.
- Relations use ID arrays (e.g., `Node.buildingIds`, `Road.truckIds`).

## Public Types (excerpt)

```ts
// BuildingBase { id, nodeId, kind, truckIds }
// Building | Depot {capacity, packageIds} | GasStation {capacity} | Site {packageIds}
```

## Implementation Notes

- Entities are stored in normalized maps in `SimSnapshot`.
- Reducers replace entire entity objects when applying patches to avoid accidental mutation of frozen snapshots.
