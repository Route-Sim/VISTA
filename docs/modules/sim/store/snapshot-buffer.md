# SnapshotBuffer

> **Purpose:** Preserve recent snapshots so the view layer can interpolate between frames or inspect history without querying the store again.

## Context & Motivation

- Rendering often lags behind simulation ticks; a buffer provides the necessary history for smoothing and diagnostic overlays.

## Responsibilities & Boundaries

- In-scope: bounded array storage, helpers for the latest and previous entries, configurable limit.
- Out-of-scope: interpolation logic itself or persistence beyond memory.

## Implementation Notes

- `push()` appends and trims in O(n) worst case but typically operates on tiny windows (< 4 entries).
- Exposes `list()` returning a shallow copy to prevent accidental mutation.
