# SimulationState

> **Purpose:** Maintain the authoritative mutable collections internally while exposing immutable builders that return new instances on every change.

## Context & Motivation

- Systems need to chain updates without mutating shared references; `SimulationState` handles the cloning of underlying maps.

## Responsibilities & Boundaries

- In-scope: `with*`/`without*` methods per entity type, snapshot generation, and map cloning utilities.
- Out-of-scope: subscription management (handled by `SimulationStore`), time history (`SnapshotBuffer`).

## Architecture & Design

- Internally stores a `SimulationCollections` struct; private helpers (`set`, `delete`, `cloneMap`) encapsulate map copying.
- `snapshot()` returns new `Map` instances, ensuring subscribers cannot mutate the live store.
