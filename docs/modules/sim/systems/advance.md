# Advance Pipeline

> **Purpose:** Provide functional composition helpers that execute a list of pure systems over a `SimulationState` given frame timing metadata.

## Context & Motivation

- The simulation must remain deterministic and testable. Combinators (`composeSystems`, `advanceSimulation`) make it easy to assemble ordered system lists.

## Responsibilities & Boundaries

- In-scope: defining the `SimulationSystem` signature, pure composition, and a `noopSystem` for scaffolding.
- Out-of-scope: actual physics, routing, or logistics logic; those arrive as individual systems later on.

## Implementation Notes

- Composition uses `Array.prototype.reduce`, ensuring left-to-right system execution.
- When no systems are provided, `advanceSimulation` returns the input state unchanged, making bootstrapping cheap.
