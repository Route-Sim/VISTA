# Simulation State Helpers

> **Purpose:** Describe the canonical aggregate shape for all simulation entities and supply factory helpers for empty collections.

## Context & Motivation

- Centralising collection typing ensures the store, systems, and adapters share the same map structure and key/value semantics.

## Responsibilities & Boundaries

- In-scope: `SimulationCollections` for mutable maps and `SimulationSnapshot` for read-only projections, plus the `createEmptyCollections()` helper.
- Out-of-scope: mutation logic; that belongs to `SimulationState` in the store package.
