# Depot

> **Purpose:** Manage package intake and dispatch capacity while inheriting docking behaviour from `Building`.

## Context & Motivation

- Depots cap the number of packages staged at a node; downstream systems use `canAccept()` before scheduling deliveries.

## Responsibilities & Boundaries

- In-scope: storage capacity, package membership helpers, immutable add/remove operations.
- Out-of-scope: routing decisions, package lifecycle orchestration.

## Algorithms & Complexity

- `canAccept()` compares the tracked package count with declared capacity, running in O(1).
