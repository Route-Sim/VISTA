# SimStore and Snapshot Buffer

> Purpose: Provide an immutable, versioned simulation timeline. The store ingests ordered events (`tick → updates* → tick → …`), applies updates to a working draft, and commits a new frozen `SimSnapshot` on each `tick`. The `SnapshotBuffer` retains recent snapshots for time-based interpolation in `view/*`.

## Architecture & Data Flow

- `SimStore.ingest(evt)` applies reducers to a mutable working draft unless `evt.type === "tick"`.
- `SimStore.commitTick(tick, timeMs?)` freezes the draft, pushes it to `SnapshotBuffer`, and clones it as the new draft.
- `SnapshotBuffer.getBracketing(timeMs)` returns `{a, b, alpha}` for rendering interpolation.

## Public API (essential)

```ts
class SimStore {
  ingest(evt: SimEvent): void;
  commitTick(tick: number, timeMs?: number): SimSnapshot;
  getWorkingDraft(): SimDraft;
  getBuffer(): SnapshotBuffer;
}
```

## Performance & Reliability

- Snapshots are shallow-frozen to prevent accidental mutations.
- Reducers replace entity objects instead of mutating them.
- Buffer enforces monotonic `tick` and `timeMs`.
