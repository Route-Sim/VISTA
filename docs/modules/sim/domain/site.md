# Site

> **Purpose:** Represent customer or intermediate stops where packages await collection or drop-off, wrapping shared building behaviour.

## Context & Motivation

- Each site tracks its package IDs so selectors and systems can compute outstanding deliveries quickly.

## Responsibilities & Boundaries

- In-scope: storing package membership, immutable helpers for adding/removing packages.
- Out-of-scope: route assignment or SLA tracking.

## References

- [Packages](./package.md)
