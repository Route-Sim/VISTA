# Gas Station

> **Purpose:** Represent fueling points that trucks can occupy, exposing refuel capacity metrics to later systems.

## Context & Motivation

- Future fuel-consumption models need to know which nodes can replenish trucks; this class keeps it pure and serialisable.

## Responsibilities & Boundaries

- In-scope: storing capacity and leveraging base building truck membership.
- Out-of-scope: actual fuel transfer logic; that belongs to systems operating each tick.
