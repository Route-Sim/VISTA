# Simulation Store Overview

> **Purpose:** Explain how state storage components compose to deliver immutable snapshots with lightweight history for interpolation.

## Context & Motivation

- Systems and view adapters rely on consistent snapshots. The store package bundles `SimulationState`, `SimulationStore`, and `SnapshotBuffer` to achieve that.
