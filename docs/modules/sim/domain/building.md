# Building

> **Purpose:** Provide the skeletal representation of any structure that can host trucks at a node, allowing specialised facilities to compose over a consistent API.

## Context & Motivation

- Logistics locations share common needs: a node anchor and a list of present trucks. Centralising these rules prevents duplication across depots, sites, and gas stations.

## Responsibilities & Boundaries

- In-scope: node association, truck membership management, basic predicates.
- Out-of-scope: inventory (depots/sites) or service capacities (gas stations); subclasses add those concerns.

## Architecture & Design

- Constructor accepts plain DTOs but wraps trucks in a `Set`.
- Mutators (`addTruck`, `removeTruck`) return new `Building` instances, supporting deterministic snapshots.
