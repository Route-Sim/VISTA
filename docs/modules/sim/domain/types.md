# Domain Type Aliases

> **Purpose:** Provide canonical string-based identifier aliases (e.g., `NodeId`, `TruckId`) and convenience helpers shared by all simulation classes.

## Context & Motivation

- Simplifies generics when building maps in the store and selectors by grounding IDs in a common namespace.
- Keeps DTO adapters honest by reusing the same alias names used within domain constructors.

## Responsibilities & Boundaries

- In-scope: alias definitions, simple helper factories such as `uuid()` to document intent.
- Out-of-scope: validation or UUID generation; call sites remain responsible for ensuring uniqueness.
