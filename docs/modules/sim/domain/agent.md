# Agent

> **Purpose:** Track operators and their truck assignments without imposing behaviour, letting higher-level systems resolve work allocation.

## Context & Motivation

- Not every truck is autonomous; mapping agents to fleets supports scheduling algorithms and training overlays later.

## Responsibilities & Boundaries

- In-scope: immutable ID and optional assigned truck reference, helper to reassign.
- Out-of-scope: behaviour trees, UI presence.
