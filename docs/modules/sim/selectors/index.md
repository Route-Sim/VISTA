# Simulation Selectors

> **Purpose:** Offer read-only accessors that hide collection shapes and reduce repeated lookup boilerplate for view or HUD layers.

## Context & Motivation

- The store exposes maps keyed by IDs. Selectors wrap them, returning domain objects or derived arrays while respecting immutability.

## Responsibilities & Boundaries

- In-scope: ID-based lookups (`selectNode`, `selectTruck`), collection helpers (`listTrucksByBuilding`, `listPackagesOnTruck`).
- Out-of-scope: mutation, caching, side effects.

## Implementation Notes

- Functions immediately bail out when an entity is missing, returning empty arrays to simplify consumer logic.
- Derived lists use type guards to filter `undefined` results, preserving static typing.
