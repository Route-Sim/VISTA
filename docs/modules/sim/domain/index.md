# Simulation Domain Models

> **Purpose:** Establish a type-safe, object-oriented representation of the transport network so higher layers manipulate logistics concepts without leaking infrastructure details.

## Context & Motivation

- Problem solved: encode topology, capacities, and ownership rules in cohesive classes instead of scattered data structures.
- Requirements: immutability-by-construction, small well-defined APIs per class, pure TypeScript with no view or network dependencies.
- Dependencies: basic aliases in `types.ts`; downstream consumers include stores, systems, and adapters.

## Responsibilities & Boundaries

- In-scope: domain invariants (e.g., unique IDs, per-entity membership lists, helper predicates) and behaviour that mutates state by returning new instances.
- Out-of-scope: persistence, event timing, visualization; these concern other layers.

## Architecture & Design

- Each entity lives in its own file, enabling SOLID-aligned single-responsibility classes.
- Constructors accept DTO-like params but immediately wrap collections with `Set` instances to guarantee uniqueness.
- Methods follow an immutable pattern: they either read state or return fresh instances with changes applied.
